title: What Would Get Me to Switch to Windows?
tag: computing

Or, as I like to think about it: what would get me to switch out a critical component of the machine on which my livelihood depends?
For simplicity, let's assume that Microsoft's misdeeds have been forgiven and I trust them as much as I trust any other software vendor.
It's actually a really interesting question on several fronts despite---or because of---it being so short.


## Switching to Windows?

### How do I use my computer?

A bit of workflow that has absolutely changed my game is having a 2D grid of virtual desktops that can be navigated using the keyboard.
Importantly, the desktops should *stay where they are* and windows should move between them *only when I move them*.
The 1D virtual desktops on MacOS and Cinnamon were what drove me away from those environments, and especially the reshuffling that'd happen on Mac when I wasn't careful.

This is not to say that I'd never use anything else.
I haven't looked into tiling window managers, for example.
Also, I feel like there are improvements that could be made to the desktop grid, I just don't know what they are yet.
If I were to switch to Windows, I would need a desktop grid, and I'm only just beginning.

### Package Manager

### Respect the Machine's Owner

update when *I* say so

don't corrupt disks, even if it means it boots faster


### The Cost

If we've gotten this far, then I wouldn't mind using Windows at work.
But why would I pay $200+ for Windows when Linux already does all this stuff for free?
Even if Windows were free as in beer, I wouldn't bother using it at home until it's also...

### Free as in Speech


## The Catch 22s

With all changes to Windows, would it even be Windows anymore?
Sure, it'd be the same different kernel, and there'd still be backslashes instead of slashes as filepath separators, but that's not what makes Windows "Windows".
The above is more just a list of things I like about Linux and Unix than things Windows realistically could do.

So, under what circumstances would I switch to Windows-as-it-is?
Basically, it would have to come to dominate the entire industry to the point where I could no longer find a job that wasn't deeply Windows-based.
The catch is that in this scenario, I would rather find a new career.
I've been wondering recently what it would take to become a machinist.

It's kinda a disappointing answer, but I don't think there's a way for me to switch back to Windows.
With so few operating systems available to choose from, it's tragic to see that I've actually got even fewer realistic options.
I'd also like to think I'm quite open-minded, and I didn't think before now that I had so shut down Windows in my mind.
That said, I also wouldn't switch back to outhouses after flush toilets and indoor plumbing unless I had to.
If Windows doesn't work well for me, then there's no point pretending.


## Switching away from *nix?

Let's make one thing clear: Linux is not perfect, and I expect other Unices aren't either.
In fact, they're nowhere near perfect, they just happen to work practically.

### What is "Practical"?

Primarily when I describe an OS as practical, that means near-universal hardware support and a working audio-visual system.
On top of that, common applications need to run.
In user-land, that's desktop environments, modern web browsers, at least one office suite, and development toolchains for all the languages.
In sysadmin-land, that's a package manager and plenty of permissions control.
