title: Toolmakersâ€™ Manifesto

People want to get things done.
Often, a person can get a thing done faster or easier by using a machine.
Unfortunately, out of all the kinds of machines in the world, only a few would actually help, and the rest would be a hinderance[^opportunity-cost].
Therefore, people need to look at what machines are available, and choose one that will be suitable for what the want to get done.

[^opportunity-cost]: Even if that hinderance is only opportunity cost, that's a hinderance.

A person who makes machines probably has a good idea what their machines are useful for.
Thet do not, however, know exactly what you want to get done; they don't even know who you are.
Only the (potential) user of a machine knows what they want to get done, so only they know what the requirements are for a machine to actually be helpful.


* No manufacturer can promise that "It will make your life better!"; that's just an empty promise.
    What they _can_ do is educate others about what their machines are good at, and what they're bad at.
    Potential users can then make an informed decision.
    With that empowerment, they will be less likely to walk away feeling cheated, and less likely to convince others to avoid giving you money.
    Besides, if that user is trying to do something good, you'll have helped the world instead of hindered it.
* You can't recommend a machine just because it works for you.
    It's common for others to have such different needs that the thing that works amazingly for you simply won't work at all for them.
    You can't bash a machine just because it didn't work for you.
    It's common for others to have such different needs that the thing that failed miserably for you works perfectly for them.
    Not abiding this point is why we get religious wars.
    Not just literal religious wars, but also figurative ones, like over operating systems.
* Every extra machine a person needs to make your machine work is a constriction on your market.
    Unless you try to brush that stuff under the rug...
* Taking over the entire marketspace is not always compatible with helping the world.
    Even if you're happy about and proud of the product.

!!! note
    Below is the original version of this article.
    I realized it could be more general and less rant-y, but here's the seed idea, b/c I haven't finished writing the original.[^or-ranting]

[^or-ranting]: More like, haven't finished feeling frustrated about containerization.

Containerization makes things easier for the developer.
For the user, it makes things harder.

Oh, you distribute using acme-container?
I don't have that.
Let me first install acme-container alongside the half-dozen other containerizers I have.
Only then will I be able to install the software you want me to have.

My stance is that distributing portable software is irreducibly hard.
Users have different needs, which means they've all got different systems.
Sometimes, groups of people have needs that are quite similar, and these people should come together to agree on what works for all of them.
That's a standards body, and they produce standards documents.
It is possible to support software that targets a set of standards (even if they're not "official" i.e. markdown).

There is a standard for workstations: POSIX.
Unfortunately, everyone hates it, and that's largely because it wasn't built in the open, and hasn't been updated regularly.
