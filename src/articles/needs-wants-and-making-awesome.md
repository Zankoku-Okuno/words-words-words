Clothing is important to people, and it has been for a long time.
It might not be immediately obvious, but it turns out that people's lives are improved when clothing gets cheaper, or more comfortable, or more fashionable.
I mean, would you pay a hundred dollars for scratchy wool underpants? Of course not! I'd much rather pay ten bucks for a six-pack of cotton underpants.

Nowadays, digital information is becoming more and more important to more and more people, and it doesn't look like that trend will end any time soon.
Soon enough, we'll be in a situation where improving the quality, efficiency, and the understandability of programs is going to improve everyone's lives, and even now, it will improve lots of people's lives, even those that don't currently own a computer.
For programmers, this translates into a sort of moral imperative: the better you know what code is and how it works, the more awesome you can make in the world.
