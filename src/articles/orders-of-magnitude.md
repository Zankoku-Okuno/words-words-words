I think one of the things that make computers feel like magic to people, even computer professionals, is the sheer range of magnitudes involved.

  * 16EiB (2^64^ ~ 16 × 10^18^): memory addressable in a 64-bit machine
  * 4GiB (2^32^ ~ 4 × 10^9^)
  * 64KiB (2^16^ = 64 × 10^3^)
  * 1ms (10^-3^)
  * 1µs (10^-6^)
  * 1ns (10^-9^)
  * 0.3ns (3 × 10^-9^): cycle time of a modern CPU

That's more than 27 decimal orders of magnitude pulling against each other all inside one box.
This is what physicists call "astronomical".
Hobbyist precision machining commonly deals with a measly fives orders of magnitude.
Twenty-seven orders is beyond the human capacity to imagine.
Is it any wonder people cannot imagine how computers work?
