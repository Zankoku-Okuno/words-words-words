# Notes on the Organization of Groups of Mostly Strangers

Groups-of-mostly-strangers --- a.k.a. communities, societies, civilizations --- are a fascinating object of study in my explorations of design.
The fundamental principles of organizing a society --- a.k.a. ideology --- are not well-known.
Many ideologies compete with one another to become the dominant organizational principle.

I don't expect to answer the question of which societal model is best.
I expect even less that I will be able to prove my ideas to anyone.
These are mere notes, albeit notes I am holding to a certain standard.
In particular, no ideological idea I have is safe from scrutiny.

Ideologies -- recall these are merely complexes of ideas about societal design --- are creatures to which individual humans play host.
Since ideas are a new, and relatively primitive life-form that feed off human attention, their presence is not often noticed by the host.
Ideologies, because they are particularly important for the functioning of a society, are among the first and therefore deepest ideas that inhabit with their host.
Many humans are therefore unable to recognize their own ideology, though they have no trouble identifying competing ideologies.
The hosts of those competing ideologies are more often than not branded as "enemy".
This situation is unacceptable in my opinion, as it is an instance of an idea controlling a human --- parasitism --- rather than a human and their ideas existing in a healthy symbiosis.
The unfortunate reality is that an important block of audience will just get angry and leave if I mention their enemy neutrally, so I will be avoiding all mention of specific ideologies.


## What Makes a Good Society?

My foundational principle for evaluating ideologies is based in the following question:

> Select a single person at random from society, but do not tell me about them.
> If I bet the subjective quality of my life on the subjective quality of theirs, would I like my chances?

Essentially, I think a good society is one in which the most number of people can succeed as much as possible.

The most important thing about this method is that it doesn't allow my preferences to enter the equation.
Strict adherence eliminates the one of the most damaging human biases (at least in terms of designing a society): egocentrism
It also keeps at bay my symbiotic ideology, whose preferences can so easily overwhelm my own thought process in defense of itself.


## Freedom

Is individual freedom a fundamental principle in the theory of societal structure?

It is certainly easy to maximize the freedom of every individual: simply eliminate all restrictions from the society.
Unfortunately, there will be a few people whose goal will be to damage the quality of others' lives.
Maximization of individual freedom therefore does not pass my test for a good society.
In fact, it is clear that freedom must be restricted in some way.
The difficult part is deciding which freedoms to curtail, and in what manner to enforce those limitations.

It is particularly damaging to evaluate a society with respect to the freedom or curtailment of freedom of a specific individual.
Such a method involves major biases: cherry-picking data based on how much you relate to the individual in question.
No rational thought can survive a combination of egocentrism and statistical failure such as this.

Freedom is not the end goal.
It may help or hinder a society.
It therefore must be carefully considered.
