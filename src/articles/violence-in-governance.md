title: Violence in Governance

It's a question of Nash equilibria.
There are systems where a simple change will make all the options worse, but everyone's lives better.
It's messier on the large scale, but the principle applies.
The simple change is taxes and enforcement through violence.
They make all the options worse, but ultimately, our lives are... better?
When you live in a robust society, it's not always clear that some form of anarchy wouldn't be better, but in every region where anarchy has arisen, people's lives have gotten worse, and it takes a long time to get better.


War must involve at least two groups of people using violence against each other.
A monopoly on violence is, by definition, the abolition of war.
As violence comes naturally, the only way to sustain this state is to have only one group.
The violence it uses will be violence against itself.
Inevitably, there will be a specialization of labor: those that are best at using violence become solders and police.
A danger then arises: if a society splits with the warriors on one side, there is no longer a monopoly on violence, merely a monopoly on effective violence.
I expect the people who seem the most authoritarian believe they are not, but they are also on the side of the warriors.

Monopoly on violence cannot be the only thing we seek in our government.
If we did, we'd merely have one group of selfish humans pulled from the population of all us selfish humans excercising their selfishness on everyone else.
What we need are people who can unify a society.
Their primary tasks must be facilitating communication, and expressing the decisions of the society.
Secondarily, it must be responsible for enforcement, but enforcement is not merely the dispensing of violence.
Where violence is needed is in times of uncertainty, which means violence will inevitably be used improperly.
Society must recompense people for any misplaced violence used against them.
Just as we should be conservative in our pronouncement fo guilt, we should be liberal in our compensation.


When you can't explain why something is a good idea, then what hope do you have of convincing someone else?
If you can't convince others, then your last and only resort is violence.


It should be made clear that taxes and violence are two different things.
Taxes reduce the amount someone would have gotten; violence reduces what someone already has.
The threat of violence is also not violence: it is only a threat, duh.
The three are interlinked, but different.
Those differences do matter, like the difference between parental and romantic love.
